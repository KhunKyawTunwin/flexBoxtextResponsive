            Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living
            species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the
            African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only
            surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order
            Proboscidea.

          <h2>Trunk</h2>
          <p>
            The trunk, or proboscis, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip,
            although in early fetal life, the upper lip and trunk are
            separated.[6] The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the
            elephant's most important and versatile appendage. It contains up to
            150,000 separate muscle fascicles,[42] with no bone and little fat.
            These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial
            (surface) and internal. The former are divided into dorsals,
            ventrals, and laterals while the latter are divided into transverse
            and radiating muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony
            opening in the skull.

          <h2>Elephants help maintain forest and savanna ecosystems</h2>
          <p>
            Elephants are our planet’s “ecosystem engineers” whose activities
            create and maintain habitat beneficial for many other species.
            Feeding elephants push over trees, creating open mosaics and
            woodlands. Wallowing elephants help remove sediment from waterholes,
            and their annual treks create miles of trails that have been used by
            wildlife for centuries.
          </p>

          <h2>Elephants are fighting for survival</h2>
          <p>
            These species live in different parts of the world, but poaching for
            the ivory trade and extreme habitat loss from human settlement
            remain persistent threats to each. To ensure long-term survival of
            the species, Rainforest Trust has established protected areas that
            safeguard critical habitat for all three elephant species across the
            globe in places like Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Central
            African Republic, Kenya, Cameroon, South Sudan, Mozambique, Myanmar,
            Indonesia, India, Malaysia and Thailand.

          <h2>Etymology</h2>
          <p>
            The word "elephant" is based on the Latin elephas (genitive
            elephantis) ("elephant"), which is the Latinised form of the Greek
            ἐλέφας (elephas) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephantos[1]), probably from
            a non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician.[2] It is attested
            in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (genitive e-re-pa-to) in Linear B
            syllabic script.[3][4] As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek
            word to mean ivory, but after the time of Herodotus, it also
            referred to the animal.[1] The word "elephant" appears in Middle
            English as olyfaunt (c.1300) and was borrowed from Old French
            oliphant (12th century).[2]
          </p>
          <h2>Ears</h2>
          <p>
            Elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or
            pinnae, contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries. Warm
            blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body
            heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still,
            and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear
            surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of
            all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest
            climates, and have the largest ear flaps.[40] Elephants are capable
            of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz (in
            close proximity to the Soprano C).[41]

          <p>
            African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered
            and African forest elephants as Critically Endangered by the
            International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the
            biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the
            animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild
            elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local
            people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past,
            they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on
            display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses.
            Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art,
            folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.

            Teeth Closeup of the cheek teeth of a dead juvenile bush elephant
            Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the incisors, known as the tusks,
            12 deciduous premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which
            grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of
            adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth
            rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six
            times in a typical elephant's lifetime.

          <h2>Size</h2>
          <p>
            Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African bush
            elephants are the largest species, with males being 304–336 cm (10
            ft 0 in – 11 ft 0 in) tall at the shoulder with a body mass of
            5.2–6.9 t (5.7–7.6 short tons) and females standing 247–273 cm (8 ft
            1 in – 8 ft 11 in) tall at the shoulder with a body mass of 2.6–3.5
            t (2.9–3.9 short tons). Male Asian elephants are usually about
            261–289 cm (8 ft 7 in – 9 ft 6 in) tall at the shoulder and 3.5–4.6
            t (3.9–5.1 short tons) whereas females are 228–252 cm (7 ft 6 in – 8
            ft 3 in) tall at the shoulder and 2.3–3.1 t (2.5–3.4 short tons).
            African forest elephants are the smallest species, with males
            usually being around 209–231 cm (6 ft 10 in – 7 ft 7 in) tall at the
            shoulder and 1.7–2.3 t (1.9–2.5 short tons). Male African bush
            elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian
            elephants are only around 15% taller than females.[25] The skeleton
            of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones.[34] The vertebrae are
            connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility.
            African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have
            19 or 20 pairs.[35]
            <head>
              An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces
              generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head
              collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out,
              creating arches that protect the brain in every direction.[36] The
              skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of
              the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give
              the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium
              is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment
              of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and
              heavy.[34] Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively
              short to provide better support.[6] Lacking a lacrimal apparatus,
              the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable
              nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of
              vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the
              eyes.[37] Elephants are considered dichromats[38] and they can see
              well in dim light but not in bright light.[39] The trunk, or
              proboscis, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in
              early fetal life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.[6] The
              trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most
              important and versatile appendage.

            Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically
            as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the
            mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing
            tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to
            three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out at four
            to six years old. The third set falls out at 9–15 years of age and
            set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth
            falls out at the early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must
            last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have
            loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped
            in African elephants.[49]
